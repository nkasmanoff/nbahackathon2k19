Bonus Project For NBA Hackathon Entry Application
=================================================


I have no idea what will go here. However, I know that I have at my disposal a ton of cool nba associated information given 
the python nba module nba_py, and a ton of other resources available. I'll come back here with whatever I decide is the final nba project, but for now I'll be toying with different ideas until one comes up to be my favorite. 


So far...

tried to see which player on each team is passed to the most on each team, and how well they shoot the 3. 



Found team stats of every team in the past decade, and looked for similarities in a reduced dimension based on t-sne, either on just attempts, which captures teams that try to imitate others but lack the talent, and other types of groupings.
